# :tophat: Deceive
Pretend like you aren't actually feeding your ass off in League of Legends. **Deceive** allows you to mask your online status if you use the new League client.
Once started, Deceive will be a little icon in your notification tray that allows you to manage whether or not you appear as offline or mobile to your friends.  

Deceive will always mask your status, unless you turn it off yourself. You are still able to talk in lobbies and champion select. People cannot invite you, you can invite them.  
Click the [Releases](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Deceive/releases) tab at the top to download the latest version. Click the image below for a demo of Deceive.
